How would you organize a design system in Figma to ensure consistency?\
Firstly, I would place all the necessary resources into one single page and grouped by category. This would include things such as the typography, colours, and other UI elements to be used in the app. Designers and developers should be able to access this page as a single source of truth regarding the productâ€™s design.

If a developer needs details about a design component, how would you provide that using Figma?\
I would share with them the link to the Figma file that contains the design component. Once they gain access, they should be able to find the details they need by hovering over or examining the component in the file. Should they have any other questions about the design component, I will also be available to assist them.

What challenges might arise when collaborating in Figma, and how can you avoid them?\
A significant challenge could be design consistency issues. This means that when multiple people are working on the same design, it can be difficult to maintain a consistent visual style and can lead to mismatching aesthetics across the app. An ideal solution would be to create a design system page which details design guidelines, elements, or libraries specifically to the product.\

Another challenge might be the lack of granular change tracking, where it can be difficult to pinpoint exactly what elements were modified by a specific user which leads to confusion during feedback discussions. This can be addressed by having clear communication so everyone knows which exact changes were made and by who.
