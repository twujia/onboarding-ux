What is the difference between personal opinion and objective UX critique?\
Personal opinions are often subjective and are based on the person’s own preferences, meaning that their opinions on the design typically lack feedback regarding usability and accessibility. However, objective UX critique is based on actual design principles and usability heuristics which focuses on what could possibly be hindering the user experience. 

If someone gives vague feedback like "I don’t like this", how would you get more useful input?\
I think it is important to ask follow-up questions whenever feedback appears to be vague or very broad. Typically, I would ask them to elaborate on why they dislike the design and whether they have any suggestions on improving it. This would allow the feedback to be contextualised in terms of user needs which could lead to generating potential insights into making the design more user-centric.

How can you ensure that design critique sessions are productive rather than overwhelming?\
To avoid design critique sessions that end up overwhelming for everyone involved, a structured session should be followed. Maybe the session could begin with a statement of the current goal being achieved and establishing an environment that encourages constructive feedback. It would also be good to set a time limit for the discussion, which could help to focus the majority of the feedback into key features rather than iterating over small details.
