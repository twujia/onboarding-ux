If Focus Bear wanted to improve its onboarding experience, which UX research methods would be most useful?\
I think the most helpful research method would be to conduct usability testing by observing the user going through the onboarding process. Maybe we can ask the user to describe their thoughts aloud and closely observe any parts where they might hesitate or get confused. Afterwards, while we still have the userâ€™s time, we can have an interview. It would consist of multiple closed and open questions which could reveal additional insights or opinions that the user may have.

What challenges might arise when collecting self-reported user feedback?\
When collecting self-reported feedback, the data may not always be accurate or useful. For instance, users may forget details as to why they struggled with using a feature, or they may avoid being critical of the feature to remain polite. In the case of providing actual feedback, it may be too vague and fails to accurately pinpoint exactly where the feature went wrong.

How can UX designers avoid bias when conducting research?\
To avoid bias, we could obtain a diverse set of users for our research in terms of age groups, experience with technology, or whether they are neurodivergent. This ensures that the findings of our research can be applicable to a general population. We could also closely monitor the behaviour of participants (during usability testing) as the actions they take may not necessarily reflect the comments they have.
