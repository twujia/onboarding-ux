If one user complains about a feature but others like it, how should UX handle it?\
If a single user has a complaint, we should first investigate whether it is an isolated event or a real issue for the users but they did not inform us. Subsequent usability testing sessions should ask users if they have experienced this specific pain point which can help to identify the problem to be a matter of personal preference or an actual UX issue. We could also investigate the user’s complaint further by examining the context, such as their demographic or skill level.

How can patterns in feedback help identify real UX issues?\
Patterns in feedback help to separate actual UX issues from isolated cases which could be the result of the user’s personal preferences or a steep learning curve. A significant method would be to look for recurring complaints, whether through their feedback or from watching them hesitate or struggle at similar points of the app. It would also be beneficial to cross-check feedback with quantitative data gathered during the session, such as task completion times, drop-off rates, and heatmaps.

What are the risks of making changes based on limited or unverified feedback?
Making changes based on limited feedback could result in creating more usability problems in the long-term. It could create unwanted side effects (e.g. increasing font size causes text to overflow), or unnecessarily take up developtime time addressing these issues without considering if they align with user needs.
