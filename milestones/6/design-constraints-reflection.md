### If a developer tells you a design is too complex to implement, how would you respond?
I would try to find a compromise between the two of us. I would ask the developer to elaborate more on why the design is too complex, and we can work together to see how we can simplify the design whilst keeping its core function intact.

### What are some non-visual factors (e.g., performance, accessibility, load time) that can impact a UX design?
Performance and speed is greatly tied to the userâ€™s first impression of the app. If it appears to have slow loading times or constantly stutters, users may quickly leave without exploring the rest of the app. Accessibility is another important aspect to consider in UX design. Different users have different needs, especially if we are creating an app to cater towards neurodivergent individuals. Providing accessibility options (e.g. colour schemes, screen reader support, etc.) prevents excluding our users and enhances their usability of the app.

### How can UX designers help find middle-ground solutions between ideal design and technical feasibility?
I think we should prioritise the main UX goal first by having a simple design in the beginning. We can always implement visual aesthetics in the future, as long as the current design addresses critical user needs first. Furthermore, working closely with the development team could help us to account for any constraints in our design. This could help to save time in the long-term as it reduces the possibility of having to rework the design in the later stage of the development cycle.
