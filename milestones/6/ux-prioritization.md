### If a PM tells you there’s no time for a UX improvement, how would you respond?
A potential solution to this would frame the UX improvement as a contributor towards business success rather than just a design change. We could show the impact of the improvement by using evidence (e.g. data showing retention rates of users before the change), followed by highlighting the time/effort savings and positive impact we can achieve if this UX improvement was accepted. 

### How can UX designers ensure that important usability issues don’t get ignored?
It is important to keep track of the usability issues so that they do not end up being disregarded. This can be achieved by having some form of backlog where every UX issue is documented and categorised according to their priority (e.g. using MoSCoW framework). Another method would be to work closely with the project manager and development team so that addressing these issues can be part of the roadmap (e.g. during sprint planning). This ensures that these UX improvements are naturally implemented over the course of the development cycle.

### What’s the best way to present UX work as a business priority rather than a "nice-to-have"?
A good way could be to link UX work to key business metrics. We could suggest potential fixes that would directly result in improved metrics, such as user retention rates. Conversely, we can also show the negative consequences as a result of inaction with the use of our metrics or our competitor’s (e.g. showing another productivity tool solved this problem already).
