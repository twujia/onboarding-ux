What makes Focus Bear different from these apps?\
Focus Bear incorporates both features of distraction blocking and routine planning while the other apps offer one or the other. It is also important to note that Focus Bear was developed by a team with several neurodivergent members. This ensures that the decisions made to shape Focus bear are based off real challenges faced by neurodivergent users.

If you were a user, why would you choose Focus Bear over competitors?\
I would say that Focus Bear acknowledges and addresses the challenges faced by neurodivergent users. Although Tiimo is also targeted towards neurodivergent users, it does not contain the same distraction blocking capabilities that Focus Bear has. Other than that, a user might choose Focus Bear as it has the most features compared to its competitors, easily accessed in a single app.

What’s one feature that other apps have that Focus Bear doesn’t?\
Focus Bear has the morning/night routine feature that is not seen in other distraction blocker apps. Although Routinery has a more comprehensive routine-building capabilities, it does not incorporate the focus sessions that Focus Bear provides. 

Based on your research, what’s one improvement you think Focus Bear could make?\
I think Focus Bear could provide its users more choices in terms of UI customisation, such as color schemes (aside from light/dark mode), fonts and font sizes. This might help users that have issues with overstimulation in regards to vibrant colours and legibility of text.
