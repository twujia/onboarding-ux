Why do you think Focus Bear was created?\
Focus Bear was created to address the productivity needs of neurodivergent individuals, such as those diagnosed with ADHD, ASD, or a combination of both (AuDHD). The founder, Jeremy, created this app to assist in creating and maintaining a morning/night routine in addition getting work done via maintaining productivity levels.

What problem is Focus Bear solving?\
From my perspective, Focus Bear works to solve three main issues: eliminating distractions, managing executive dysfunction (difficulty controlling emotions, thoughts, and actions), and building habits. 

Why do you think this mission is important?\
Neurodivergent individuals often struggle with productivity in traditional work and academic environments. It often hinders their ability to focus as they require different tools specifically designed to fit their needs. As such, Focus Bear helps to reduce the overwhelming stress of the tasks ahead of them, and to empower neurodivergent individuals to utilise their strengths (e.g. getting users to take a break in periods of hyperfocus)instead of having to force themselves to fit into the traditional definition of productivity.

How does Focus Bearâ€™s work align with your personal values or interests?\
As a UX/UI intern, I want to help create products that are accessible, user-centered, and impactful. Rather than aiming for aesthetics, I want to ensure that Focus Bear is easily adopted by a wide variety of users whilst helping them to be more productive in general. Ultimately, it would give me a sense of fulfillment knowing that my work can help users to be less stressed and thus more happier.

Do you personally relate to any of the challenges that Focus Bear aims to solve?\
Even though I am not diagnosed with ADHD or Autism myself, I can relate to several issues that Focus Bear resolves. Often it can be a struggle for me to begin tasks and sometimes I wind up losing my focus due to the various distractions surrounding me.

Do you know someone with ADHD or autism or even someone without a diagnosis who has struggled socially or to perform well at uni?\
I personally do not know any people diagnosed with ADHD or autism, but I know a friend that occassionally struggles with getting their tasks done for the day, especially if they have a lot on their plate. They would often spend the time used for working to instead fixate on the number of tasks they have. When it was time to actually work, they end up browsing social media after only a few minutes of work.

How might Focus Bear help them?\
Focus Bear can help by narrowing their focus (setting subtasks during a focus session) which means that they only have to work on tasks one-at-a-time. Additionally, the distraction blocking feature will greatly help on keeping their focus on the right track.
