What was your first impression of the app?\
I thought that Focus Bear had a very gentle and friendly feel to it, guiding me through every feature and what it does. It was also very comprehensive through the use of popups that describe what each button does.

Did you find anything difficult to understand?\
Although the tutorials were very helpful in telling me what each button of a feature does, I had difficulty understanding what each of the features actually does.

If you had to explain Focus Bear to a friend in one sentence, what would you say?\
“Focus Bear is a productivity app meant to eliminate distractions and to help you develop consistent routines”

What are some changes that could improve the new user experience?\
I think that the onboarding process itself is too lengthy. As a new user, I just wanted to know the very basics to getting into a focus session. Once I am comfortable with that, then I would begin to explore other features or settings while navigating through the tutorial to help me. I also think that the tutorials section in the preferences tab had its own button/section so that users can easily find the help they need in setting up or using Focus Bear

**Updated answer:** I tested Focus Bear using MacOS. In terms of shortening the onboarding process, maybe it could be cut down so that it only covers the basics of setting up a focus session. The goal could be to quickly get the user into a focus session (maybe for demonstration purposes, we could set one up for them that lasts 5 seconds) before proceeding onto the next step of onboarding (e.g. setting intentions, activating features, popover window tutorial etc.). If the user feels overwhelmed with having to learn so many features in a short timespan, maybe we could also provide them the option to go through the onboarding/tutorials at their own pace (could be a small button at the top of the UI).
