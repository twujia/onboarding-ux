What do you hope to learn from this internship?\
I would like to learn more about Focus Bear in order to design or improve on its features. I'm also keen to learn more about accessible design and how best to approach it when creating a product meant for neurodivergent users. 

What skills are you most excited to develop?\
I am looking forward to putting my Figma and user research skills to work, as I have previous experience but only within an academic setting. Aside from just hard skills, I would like to gain more experience developing my soft skills as well (e.g. communication, teamwork, time management); especially in a work environment.

What do you think you can contribute to the team?\
I believe that I am able to create or improve designs informed by user feedback. Along with my previous experience with psychology, I can leverage my existing knowledge to further guide my personal design process that align with the needs of neurodivergent individuals.

What is one area you feel less confident in that youâ€™d like to improve?\
During this internship, I would like to have more exposure towards UI design. Currently, I would like to refine my ability to create interfaces that are in line with design principles and are aesthetic as well (e.g. layout, colours, typography, etc.).

What does success in this internship look like for you?\
To me, being successful at this internship would mean that I have successfully created a meaningful contribution to Focus Bear whether through improving its interfaces or the user experience. I also think being successful means being able to learn a lot from the team and receiving feedback on my work so I know how to improve each time I finish a task.
