### How can low-fidelity wireframes help avoid costly design mistakes?
- Identifying usability issues early (e.g. spotting navigation problems, confusing layouts, or missing features) before development begins
- Encourages iteration as teams can test multiple variations before committing to a final design
- Reducing rework because catching and fixing structural problems at an early stage prevents costly redesigns later in the development process
- Ensures that everyone agrees on the core functionality and user flow before proceeding to the next stage of the design process

### If a stakeholder wants to jump straight into high-fidelity design, how would you explain the value of low-fi wireframing?
I would explain that low-fidelity prototyping allows the team to focus on the structure and functionality of an app/feature first before worrying about the visual details, thereby saving time and money in the long-term. Nevertheless, it is also a quick process which will not add much delay to the overall development process.

### What are some common mistakes designers make when creating wireframes?
I am not sure since I have limited experience in creating wireframes at the moment.
- Adding too much detail in the wireframe; adding colors, images, or too many UI elements too soon can distract from the core structure.
- Having only a static layout, when a wireframe should also map out how users move through the experience
- Focusing only on desktop layouts without considering other screen sizes can lead to redesigns later
