### What usability issues can a clickable prototype reveal that a static wireframe cannot?
- Identifies any navigation issues not implemented in a static wireframe
- Interactive elements that are not recognised by the user to be clickable/tappable
- Exposes the different expectations that users may have on how the interactions work
- How easy users can recover after making a mistake

### How can prototyping help designers communicate ideas more clearly to developers?
- Clickable elements can demonstrate exact behaviours rather than descriptions using static images
- Can be more precise with moving elements (e.g. animations, transitions and their timing/easing)
- Acts as a reference point for developers to use
- Facilitates earlier collaboration as developers can discuss technical feasibility. 

### What are common mistakes designers make when creating prototypes?
- Using placeholder text instead of realistic content; we should utilise AI tools to quickly draft up relevant content which will make the prototype more immersive
- Focusing on the visual aspect too much while neglecting interactions and overall flow
- Poor organisation within the file which may confuse other teams (e.g. developers, product managers, etc.)
- Being too optimistic and creating interactions that ignore technical constraints (too difficult for developers to implement)
