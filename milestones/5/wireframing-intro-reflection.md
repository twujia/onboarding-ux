### What are the benefits of starting with wireframes rather than jumping into high-fidelity design?
Starting with a wireframe could help to save on development time and resources in the long-term. They are quick to create and modify, which enable rapid iterations using the feedback from various stakeholders. The layout and overall foundation of the design can be repeatedly adjusted until everyone is satisfied and implementing visual aesthetics (e.g. colours, styling, etc. can come afterwards.

### How can wireframes help identify usability issues early?
Wireframes can identify whether there are problems surrounding the layout and structure of the design before heading towards low or high fidelity prototyping. The simplified visuals of a wireframe eliminate any UI-related distractions while enabling the designer to solely focus on detecting any navigation, content, or accessibility issues that may occur even before visual elements are in place.

### If a stakeholder asks for a high-fidelity design too soon, how would you explain the value of wireframing?
Wireframing enables us to get the structure of the design right before we proceed to implement visual aesthetics. Going to high-fidelity prototyping prematurely could lead to expensive redesigns if we happen to identify any major usability issues as we will have to reproduce the design from the ground up with the necessary improvements. Personally, I think it would be akin to building a house, where you should decide the layout of your house before thinking about what colours to pick
