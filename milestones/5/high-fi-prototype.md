### How can a high-fidelity prototype help developers build the final product accurately?
Provides precise visual specifications (e.g. dimensions, spacing, colours, typography, animations, etc.)
Includes comments and notes explaining the reasoning behind design choices
Specifies all possible states of components (e.g. hover, pressed, depressed, etc.)

### What are the risks of focusing too much on visuals before usability is validated?
Visually appealing designs can mask potential usability issues
If visuals are complex, it could introduce additional complexity into development
Could cause rework in the late stage if usability issues are discovered before or during the development stage

### How can small details like button states, hover effects, and transitions improve the user experience?
- These small details are called micro-interactions, and can create moments of satisfaction for the user that causes the app to appear more responsive and human.
- They are able to guide users by providing feedback or visual responses to their actions.

## Figma prototype
Using the same link as clickable-prototype.md, the Terms screen uses the same design elements as Focus Bearâ€™s app and also includes interactivity between the privacy policy and software license agreement pages.
