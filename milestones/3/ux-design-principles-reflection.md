How can Focus Bear maintain a minimal, distraction-free UI while still offering powerful features?\
Focus Bear avoids the use of harsh/bright colours, making essential functions easy to find, and hiding advanced options behind menus. This helps to maintain a minimalist UI that remains visually pleasant whilst reducing the cognitive load needed to process it.

If a design change improves aesthetics but reduces usability, how should UX handle it?\
Ultimately, I think that UX should always prioritise the needs of the user over aesthetics. Even though Focus Bear may look more appealing, there would be no actual benefit if the app remains frustrating to use. This means that the design change should be reiterated in order to strike a balance between aesthetics and usability. 

What are the risks of overloading users with too many choices or settings?\
Too many choices can lead to the user experiencing decision fatigue and unnecessary cognitive load. Especially for neurodivergent users that may struggle with executive function, this ultimately will cause significant frustration when using Focus Bear. If they feel overwhelmed and feel like the abundance of options hinder the appâ€™s usability, they will end up abandoning it.
