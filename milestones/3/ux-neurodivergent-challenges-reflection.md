How can Focus Bear’s design choices make tasks easier for neurodivergent users?\
One of the key design choices that Focus Bear uses is the simple design. It ensures that every interface, element, or colour is easy on the eyes and thus reduces the chances of a neurodivergent user experiencing visual overstimulation.
Another design choice would be using straightforward text that accompanies the buttons in the interface. It tells the user what purpose each button serves while remaining uncomplicated.

If a feature is technically useful but cognitively overwhelming, how should it be redesigned?\
I think that the feature needs to be examined in-depth in order to extract the actual use it provides to the user. Once that has been established, then we can begin looking at the various ways we can implement this feature which minimises the chances of overwhelming the user. For example, maybe we can break down the onboarding process of the feature into several parts which are accessed at the user’s leisure. Or we can also thoroughly introduce the feature beforehand so that the user completely understands its use case before attempting to use it themselves.

What are some small UX adjustments that can significantly improve user experience for neurodivergent users?\
A few low-risk-high-reward changes would mostly result from modifying the aesthetics of the product. Offering more personalisation options (colours, font, font size) could allow users to tailor their own version of Focus Bear that enhances visibility while reducing cognitive load. Although already implemented, Focus Bear offers the option of reducing or disabling animations within the app. This significantly helps with users that struggle with moving or flashing objects on the screen.
