If a new feature looks visually appealing but is hard to use, how should UX designers handle that tradeoff?\
If a new feature ends up being difficult to use despite looking good, the feature’s design should be reconsidered. The feature’s core issue should be identified, possibly through the feedback of users that found it hard to use. Once identified, the design should be iterated on where the UX team explores ways to simplify the interaction whilst keeping the aesthetics. Ultimately, I believe that the feature should always place the user’s needs above its visuals.

What specific challenges might neurodivergent users face when using productivity apps?\
Neurodivergent users have various cognitive challenges when using productivity apps, such as being prone to distractions, executive dysfunction, and sensory overload. These are all issues that Focus Bear aims to address in terms of its design both feature-wise and aesthetics-wise. 

How can Focus Bear's UX differentiate itself from other productivity tools?\
Focus Bear already differentiates itself from other productivity apps by catering to the needs of neurodivergent users. However, it can still grow to be different from the competition through various needs. I believe that offering more personalisation options (colours, fonts, etc.) will allow users who are prone to overstimulation to tailor the appearance of Focus Bear to suit their needs.
