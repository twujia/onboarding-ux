### When should you use AI for assistance, and when should you rely on your own skills?
I think AI should be used during the initial stages of a task, such as getting it to generate ideas during a brainstorming session. I also think that it can help with automating repetitive tasks, where an example would include document formatting or summarising a piece of research. Although AI can assist us in a lot of tasks, it should not replace our decision-making as it is up to us to make the final decision.

### How can you avoid over-reliance on AI while still benefiting from it?
The most important factor would be to treat AI like a tool, rather than a crutch. It is there to help you get to the solution but it should not be the end product. We can do this by reviewing and refining the output that AI generates and making sure that it aligns with our goals.

### What steps will you take to ensure data privacy when using AI tools?
The most essential step would be to avoid entering sensitive information, such as passwords, API keys, or proprietary code. If taking such a step is unavoidable, the next best solution would be to anonymise the data (e.g. sharing user feedback into AI to generate insights).


### Identify one task you can improve using an AI tool, and try it out.
I used AI to summarise the results from a usability test I recently conducted. It was able to succinctly condense the strengths and weaknesses that the participant brought up during testing, and categorised them according to their semantic groups.

### Review the AI-generated output criticallyâ€”did it require editing or fact-checking?
Although I think the AI did a decent job at summarising the results, I always manually review it to ensure that it did not add any additional information or misinterpreted something a participant has said.

### Document one best practice you will follow when using AI tools at Focus Bear.
Everytime I use an AI tool that requires information to input, I will ensure that it does not contain any sensitive or identifiable information.
