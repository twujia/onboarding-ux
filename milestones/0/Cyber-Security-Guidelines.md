### What security measures do you currently follow, and where can you improve?
I currently follow basic security measures (e.g. not reusing passwords, creating strong passwords, avoiding suspicious links). However, I could improve this by starting to use a password manager and being more cautious with public Wi-Fi.

### How can you make secure behaviour a habit rather than an afterthought?
- Locking devices if I plan to leave the area, no matter the duration. I would also enable auto-lock in the case that I forget to do so
- Always verify links and senders before clicking on links, downloading attachments, or providing information

### What steps will you take to ensure your passwords and accounts are secure?
- Ensure passwords are unique to each account and are adequately strong
- Enable two-factor authentication on any important accounts

### What would you do if you suspected a security breach or suspicious activity on your account?
- Change passwords immediately
- Try to see if I can view recent login attempts
- Report the issue to IT/security (if account is related to work)
- Monitor the account for further suspicious behaviour

### Document one new cyber security habit you will follow at Focus Bear.
I will adopt the use of a password manager and I will schedule regular (e.g. monthly) reviews and updates to my passwords.
