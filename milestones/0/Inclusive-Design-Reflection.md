### How can you adjust your communication style to be more inclusive of neurodivergent users and teammates?
- Use direct language, avoid sarcasm/metaphors and break information down into short/structured points
- Give users and teammates space to take in the information, allowing them to respond their own pace
- Respect the different communication preferences neurodivergent individuals may have, such as a preference for asynchronous communication over live conversation.

### What are some common UX or communication pitfalls that might make Focus Bear less accessible or supportive?
- An overwhelming UI with too many buttons, unclear labels, or inconsistent layout may frustrate users
- A lack of customisation options that prevents users from tailoring Focus Bear’s appearance to suit their needs (e.g. colours, font size, animation, etc.)

### What is one practical change you can make in your work to better support vulnerable populations?

Be more mindful of teammates’ communication styles when talking to them online/offline.

### Identify one design or communication improvement that could make Focus Bear more accessible.

We could make Focus Bear more accessible by introducing additional customisation options for users, specifically regarding the app’s colours, font size, and the ability to reduce/disable animations. This would allow users with sensory issues to tailor the app according to their needs.
