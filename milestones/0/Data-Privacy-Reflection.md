### What steps can you take to ensure you handle data securely in your daily tasks?
In terms of daily tasks, we can utilise a password manager so that it can generate and store unique passwords for each account. We can also be aware of emails and links (e.g. phishing attacks) and make it a habit to never leave devices unattended/unlocked.

### How should you store, share, and dispose of sensitive information safely?
We can store and share sensitive information using a secure cloud storage service, and dispose of them physically (destroying the device) or digitally (data wiping software or making sure to empty the computer bin).

### What are some common mistakes that lead to data privacy issues, and how can they be avoided?
1. Using weak passwords or reusing them across multiple accounts -> use a password manager to generate and store unique passwords for every account
2. Leaving devices unlocked -> be sure to lock devices when leaving it unattended for any period of time
3. Using public wi-fi networks -> use a VPN

### Identify at least one habit or practice you can adopt to improve data security in your role.
I will regularly review and update access permissions to files (e.g. Figma, Notion) to ensure that only authorised individuals can access it.

### Document at least one key learning or security measure you will implement.
I will begin using a password manager and update my accounts so that they no longer share any passwords.
