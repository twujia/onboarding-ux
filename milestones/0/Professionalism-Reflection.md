### Have you ever experienced or witnessed great teamwork and professionalism? What made it effective?

There was one significant experience that showed me how efficient and effective good teamwork and professionalism can positively impact the end result. I was part of a group project that consistently met every week to discuss the project’s progress, while making adjustments and dividing the work in a way that allowed everybody to contribute evenly and competently. I think another major factor to our success was that we placed a lot of trust in each other to get it done, allowing us to completely focus on the task at hand rather than worrying about the rest of the group.

### What steps can you take to make sure your communication is clear, respectful, and inclusive?
- Using concise language to keep the message clear
- Think about the different interpretations your message could give before sending it (e.g. avoid being sarcastic, unprofessional, etc.) and adjust the content/tone if needed
- Always ask someone to elaborate if you don’t understand their message, rather than making assumptions

### How can you help create a positive, fun, and professional work environment?
- Celebrating the small wins by sending encouraging messages whenever a teammate gets work done
- Make space for all voices during discussions, ensuring that quieter members are given a chance to speak their mind
- Respect teammates’ work-life balance by avoiding sending messages after hours or on days they are not working.
