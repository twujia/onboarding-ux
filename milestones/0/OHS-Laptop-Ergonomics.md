### What equipment changes can you make to improve your workspace setup? (e.g., using an external monitor, adjusting your chair, using a laptop stand)
Currently, I have adjusted the position of my chair so that I try to follow good ergonomic practices. Aside from that, I also use an external monitor and keyboard/mouse to help me do my work. This helps me to work comfortably for longer periods without experiencing eye and wrist strain.

### What behavioural changes can you implement to improve posture and reduce strain? (e.g., sitting upright, taking regular breaks, adjusting screen height)
A behavioural change I am implementing is to constantly sit upright and be in the correct posture. It is something I am trying to make a habit of because I often begin to slouch after a certain period of time

### How can you remind yourself to maintain good posture and take breaks throughout the day? (Hint: Use Focus Bear to schedule movement breaks!)
When using Focus Bear, the app can prompt me to take breaks that also help with posture and overall ergonomic health such as taking a walk or a short period of stretching. Another way to remind myself would be to have sticky notes reminding myself to sit up properly attached to the monitor. As I end up looking at it from time to time, it will remind me to correct my posture throughout the day.

### Document at least one workspace change or habit adjustment you made.
I have been given a [“posture pal”](https://www.mooiiaustralia.com/product-page/posture-pal-mofusand-shark-meow) which I have been incorporating into my workspace. The idea is that you have to prevent the stuffed animal from falling down by keeping it in place using your stomach and the desk, which naturally encourages you to maintain a proper posture throughout the day.
